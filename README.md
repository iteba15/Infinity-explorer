# Infinity Explorer

Exploring Different Forms of Infinities and Their Implications

## Overview

This project is dedicated to the exploration and understanding of various aspects of infinity in mathematics. It includes implementations of Cantor’s diagonalization argument, studies on countable and uncountable sets, and other related mathematical problems.

## Contents

- **Introduction to Infinity**: Concepts of countable and uncountable infinities.
- **Cantor’s Diagonalization**: Proof and code implementation.
- **Cardinality and Aleph Numbers**: Exploring the sizes of infinite sets.
- **Power Sets**: Understanding the implications of Cantor’s theorem on power sets.
- **Applications in Logic and Computer Science**: Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems, Turing’s Halting Problem, and complexity theory.
- **Code Examples**: Practical examples and implementations in Rust.

## Getting Started
